Tonight, I want you to feel how much I crave you — every touch, every kiss, every whispered word meant only for you.

You are my world, my obsession, my sweetest temptation. This is just the beginning of a year we’ll never forget. Let’s burn together, lose ourselves, and come back stronger, bound by the heat only we share.

All my love, and all my fire,
Yours forever. 🔥🔥🔥`;
